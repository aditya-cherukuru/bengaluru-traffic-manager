# Bengaluru Traffic Management Dashboard

## Overview

The **Bengaluru Traffic Management Dashboard** is a web application built with React that provides an interactive interface for monitoring and managing traffic at various intersections in Bengaluru. The application visualizes traffic data and system metrics, allowing users to simulate faults, repair intersections, and analyze traffic patterns.

## Features

- **Real-time Traffic Data:** Displays vehicle counts, emergency vehicle counts, and operational status for different intersections.
- **OS Metrics Visualization:** Monitors CPU usage, memory usage, disk usage, and the number of processes running on the system.
- **Interactive Charts:** Utilizes Recharts to visualize traffic flow and other metrics, providing insights into traffic patterns.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Built with Material-UI for a responsive and aesthetically pleasing design.
- **Dark/Light Mode:** Supports theme switching for user preference.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:**
  - React
  - React Router
  - Recharts
  - Material-UI
  - Lucide-react for icons

- **State Management:** 
  - React Hooks (useState, useEffect)

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bengaluru-traffic-management-dashboard.git
   cd bengaluru-traffic-management-dashboard

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
